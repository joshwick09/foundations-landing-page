# foundations-landing-page

For this project I wanted to create a rough draft to a personal project that I will be working on after completing TOP. 

I'll be constructing a design porfolio page for myself. I went to school from graphic design, but want to end up in the UX/UI design industry and I believe this sort of project will be a strong step in showing off my value in this type of role to potential employers.

I'll upload custom design that I've created as well as my business logo to fill in the information for this project. As far as color goes, we will base it on my logo and brand. 

Wish me the best of luck!
